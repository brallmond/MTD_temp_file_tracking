# MTD_temp_file_tracking
This is a temporary repo for file management while Serenity is offline. This allows us to continue developing with KCU
105 and also track our files. When centralized file sharing is setup, we will merge.

The "Hackathon" folder is snapshot of work near the end of "Hackathon II." It serves as a starting point for continued
SCA development and integration into the CC class.

The "new_sca_files" folder is where I am keeping my current work with sca. Included is a file called sca_enum.py, which
was copied from Hassen's directory. Ideally, I would clone his repo, make a new branch, make changes, and then PR them.
Even more ideally, we would all have a central repo. The "commits.txt" note referes to changes made to the sca_enum.py
file.
